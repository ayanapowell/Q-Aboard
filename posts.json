He's not even the biggest donor to the foundation, having given about $3.7 million in the previous two decades while businesses associated with Vince McMahon’s World Wrestling Entertainment gave the Trump Foundation $5 million. All the money since 2006 has come from those doing business with him.<br>How does giving away other people’s money, in what could be seen as a kickback scheme, make him a philanthropist?",
